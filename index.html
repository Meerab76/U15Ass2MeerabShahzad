    <h2>Welcome to Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum</h2>
    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester is a registered charity dedicated to preserving and promoting Slovak language and culture. We provide Slovak language education and organize cultural and community activities to help Slovak-speaking families maintain their heritage while living abroad.</p>
    <p>While our primary focus is on supporting Slovak-speaking children and families, we warmly welcome anyone interested in learning the Slovak language and engaging with our traditions. Beyond our Saturday school, we offer various workshops, events, and social activities where individuals of all ages can connect, learn, and take part in our cultural community.</p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, our mission goes beyond just teaching the Slovak language. We are here to keep our heritage alive, to ensure that children growing up abroad don’t lose their connection to their roots, and to create a place where Slovak culture thrives—even far from home.</p>
    <p>We believe that language is more than just words; it carries identity, history, and a sense of belonging. Through our work, we bring Slovak-speaking families together, helping them build friendships, strengthen their cultural ties, and feel at home even while living in the UK.</p>
    <p>Education is at the heart of what we do, but our purpose extends even further. We are here to bridge the gap between the UK and Slovak education systems, ensuring that children who may one day return to Slovakia are well-prepared.</p>
